In order to run this basic example, follow the steps below - 
sudo npm install -g httpster
This helps to run a server from any location on my computer.
Now go into the folder in terminal and type - 
httpster
Optionally you can provide port (and also directory information)
httpster -d ./learn-react -p 3000
The -d is for directory and -p is port
Verify the app by going to http://localhost:3000
